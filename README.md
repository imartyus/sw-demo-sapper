## SW API Demo built with Sapper :rocket:
---
I made this application as a reference to learn Svelte framework and also to try out their NextJS-like project Sapper. In addition, I've used Bulma CSS framework for baseline styling.

The backend part is simply proxying the requests to SW API to simulate an API server.

### Deployment:
1. Make a production build with `npm run build`
2. The output can be run as a Node app with `node __sapper__/build`

### Reference links:

- [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
